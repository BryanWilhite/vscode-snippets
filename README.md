# my @Code snippets

Since I am not particularly interested in [syncing _all_ of my Visual Studio Code settings](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync) across _all_ of my machines, I am compelled to get granular with the snippets.

On Windows, the default snippets folder is `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets`. I am plunking a repository directly in this folder.
