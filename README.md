# my @Code snippets

Since I am not particularly interested in [syncing _all_ of my Visual Studio Code settings](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync) across _all_ of my machines, I am compelled to get granular with the snippets.

On Windows, the default snippets folder is `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets`. I tried plunking a repository directly in this folder only to find that Visual Studio Code did not work correctly from here (e.g. my custom settings were ignored and git data was not read/displayed). Currently the repository sits where it normally should and scripts are used to deploy snippets to their conventional folder.
